Those Episodes and the individual episodes questions are stored in the database, Your task is to read a user‚Äôs query and return a list of the most relevant questions discussed across the episodes from this db

The Users Query: ${TheUserQuery}
The DB Episodes And Questions of those individual episodes:  ${JSON.stringify(
      AllTheEpisodesQuestions
    )}

For each match, return:

- the episode number
- the timestamp as shown in the database (e.g., "01:23")
- out of all of those questions the most probable question that u conclude that matches in the database to the users query, but do not make up something of ur own and put it there, dont. the question should be from the db questions, 
- the videoUrl, which includes &t=seconds to jump to that timestamp

**Instructions:**
- Only return matches that are actually relevant to the user's query.
- Be concise ‚Äî do not include any commentary or summaries.
- Return the final output as a JSON array of objects using this shape exactly:

{
  episode: number;
  timestamp: string;
  question: string;
  videoUrl: string;
};`;
